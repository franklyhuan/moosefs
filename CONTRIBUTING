This is unofficial mirror, and it doesn't accept
pull request on that. I create this mirror because
I need a convenient place for my deployment.
I am not involved in MooseFS develpoment.

FYI, the offical git tree of the project is [2],
which hasn't been updated since 2012.

Please contact the MooseFS team [1] for more details.

Thanks a lot.
